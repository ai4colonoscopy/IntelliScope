Colonoscopy is currently one of the most sensitive screening methods for colorectal cancer (🔗 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer)). Have you ever wondered how to make colonoscopy smarter? Well, buckle up, let's enter the exciting world of intelligent colonoscopy!

- **Our vision.** To explore the frontiers of intelligent colonoscopy techniques and their potential impact on multimodal medical applications.
- **Why use IntelliScope?** It combines "**Intelli**gent" and "colono**Scope**", where "Intelli" reflects the intelligent processing and decision-making capabilities of the system, and "Scope" refers to the colonoscope device used in medical endoscopy. Together, they imply a cutting-edge multimodal system designed to improve colonoscopy with advanced AI technologies.

#### ✅ Quick start

We show a code snippet to show you how to quickly try-on our ColonGPT model with HuggingFace transformers quickly. For convenience, we manually combined some configuration and code files and merged the weights. Please note that this is a quick code, we recommend you installing ColonGPT's source code to explore more.

- Before running the snippet, you only need to install the following minimum dependencies.
    ```shell
    conda create -n quickstart python=3.10
    conda activate quickstart
    pip install torch transformers accelerate pillow
    ```
- Then you can use `python script/quick_start/quickstart.py` to start.


    ```python
    import torch
    import transformers
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, StoppingCriteria
    from PIL import Image
    import warnings

    transformers.logging.set_verbosity_error()
    transformers.logging.disable_progress_bar()
    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

    device = 'cuda'  # or cpu
    torch.set_default_device(device)

    model_name = "ai4colonoscopy/ColonGPT"

    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        torch_dtype=torch.float16,  # or float32 for cpu
        device_map='auto',
        trust_remote_code=True
    )

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        trust_remote_code=True
    )

    class KeywordsStoppingCriteria(StoppingCriteria):
        def __init__(self, keyword, tokenizer, input_ids):
            self.keyword_id = tokenizer(keyword).input_ids
            self.tokenizer = tokenizer
            self.start_len = input_ids.shape[1]

        def __call__(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor, scores: torch.FloatTensor, **kwargs) -> bool:
            for keyword_id in self.keyword_id:
                if keyword_id in input_ids[0, -len(self.keyword_id):]:
                    return True
            return False

    prompt = "Categorize the object."
    text = f"USER: <image>\n{prompt} ASSISTANT:"
    text_chunks = [tokenizer(chunk).input_ids for chunk in text.split('<image>')]
    input_ids = torch.tensor(text_chunks[0] + [-200] + text_chunks[1], dtype=torch.long).unsqueeze(0).to(device)

    image = Image.open('cache/examples/example2.png')
    image_tensor = model.process_images([image], model.config).to(dtype=model.dtype, device=device)

    stop_str = "<|endoftext|>"
    stopping_criteria = KeywordsStoppingCriteria(stop_str, tokenizer, input_ids)

    output_ids = model.generate(
        input_ids,
        images=image_tensor,
        do_sample=False,
        temperature=0,
        max_new_tokens=512,
        use_cache=True,
        stopping_criteria=[stopping_criteria]
    )

    outputs = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0, input_ids.shape[1]:]).replace("<|endoftext|>", "").strip()
    print(outputs)
    ```

#### ✅ Try full-version ColonGPT

The complete workflow scheme has been officially released, providing a streamlined and user-friendly process. This allows even average community users to easily develop, customize, and enhance their own models. To ensure a smooth experience, we have included comprehensive step-by-step instructions (🔗 [`.docs/guideline-for-ColonGPT.md`](https://github.com/ai4colonoscopy/ColonGPT/blob/main/docs/guideline-for-ColonGPT.md)), which can be found in our detailed documentation. These resources are designed to guide users through every stage of the development process, making it accessible and efficient for both beginners and advanced practitioners.

- 🤖 [How to train?](https://github.com/ai4colonoscopy/IntelliScope/blob/main/docs/guideline-for-ColonGPT.md#-training) Our model is a resource-friendly multimodal language model that can be trained in under seven hours using just two NVIDIA H200 GPUs. This efficient model is also compatible with other Amperer GPUs, such as NVIDIA 4090 card, making it accessible to a wider range of hardware setups.
- 👨‍🔬 [How to infer?](https://github.com/ai4colonoscopy/IntelliScope/blob/main/docs/guideline-for-ColonGPT.md#-inference-instructions) We support three inference modes, including batch inference, CLI inference, and Gradio WebUI inference.

## 🚨 Ethical and Responsible Use

ColonGPT is designed to assist in medical colonoscopy by leveraging multimodal capabilities, but it comes with no guarantees regarding its predictive accuracy or reliability in clinical practice. Users should be aware that the datasets and pre-trained models used in ColonGPT may contain inherent biases, including socioeconomic factors, which can lead to misclassification or other undesirable behaviors, such as the generation of offensive or inappropriate content.

We urge users and developers to carefully review and validate the performance of pre-trained models, particularly those integrated through the ColonGPT framework, before considering practical applications in a clinical setting. It is crucial that any AI-driven tool used in healthcare undergoes rigorous testing to ensure patient safety and avoid unintended consequences. Our commitment to ethical AI use extends to ongoing efforts to investigate, address, and mitigate the risks of bias and inappropriate behavior in ColonGPT. Continuous improvement of this codebase is a priority to ensure that the system aligns with responsible and equitable healthcare standards.
